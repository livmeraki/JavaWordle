### Project Description
<p>The original Wordle is a word-guessing game where the player tries guessing a five-letter word within limited attempts, receiving accuracy feedback in each try.</p>
<p>The goal of the project is to develop an implementation of the Wordle game in Java programming language.</p>
<p>The final implementation will include a graphical user interface (GUI) that receives keyboard inputs from the user and responds with visual feedback.In the feedback, the correct letters in the correct position of the userâ€™s guess will be highlighted in green, while the correct letters in incorrect positions will be in yellow, and the incorrect letters in gray.</p> 
<p>Overall, through this project, our team aims to deepen our understanding of Java programming and gain experience in collaborative game development.</p>
